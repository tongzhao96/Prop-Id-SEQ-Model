Particularly, the task of this project is **Propaganda Identification**. The given dataset contains (manual) annotations indicating fragments of text that exhibit one of a set of well-known [propaganda techniques](https://propaganda.qcri.org/annotations/definitions.html). Your task is to develop NLP models to identify these propagandistic spans of text automatically. We will treat this as a **sequence-tagging task**: for each token in the input text, assign a label $y\\in\\{0,1\\}$, such that *1 represents propagandistic text* and *0 represents non-propaganda*.   (A description of the original task formulation is [here](https://propaganda.qcri.org/ptc/).  We are working on a modified version of their \"span identification\" task.)\n","\n","For this project, you will implement two sequence labeling approaches:\n","\n","- Model 1 : a Hidden Markov Model (HMM)\n","- Model 2 : a Maximum Entropy Markov Model (MEMM), which is an adaptation of an HMM in which a Logistic Regression classifier (also known as a MaxEnt classifier) is used to obtain the lexical generation probabilities (i.e., the observation/emission probability matrix, so \"observations\" == \"emissions\" == \"lexical generations\").  Feature engineering is strongly suggested. (Papers from the [Workshops on Figurative Language Processing](https://sites.google.com/view/figlang2020/) can provide good insights on feature selection for this task.) You can also refer to the J&M book. \n","\n","Implementation of the Viterbi algorithm (for finding the most likely tag sequence to assign to an input text) is required for both parts, so make sure that you understand it ASAP.\n","\n","You will implement and train two sequence tagging models, generate your predictions for the provided test set, and submit them to **Kaggle**. Please enter all code and answer the questions of this colab notebook.\n","\n","**Jurafsky & Martin reading on HMMs and MEMMs can be found in Ch. 8.3â€“8.5.** The code you write can be added anywhere in the document, but we implore you to keep it readable. You will be asked to describe and motivate your models in parts of the document. You will be graded on both the code and text you write; see grading details at the end of the document.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"q2z7TIHV3kCH"},"source":["# Notes\n","\n","---\n","\n","1.

Google colab does **not** provide good synchronization; we do not recommend multiple people to work on the same notebook at the same time.\n","4. The project is somewhat open ended. (\"But that's a good thing.  Really. It's more fun that way\", says Claire and Esin.) We will ask you to implement some model, but precise data structures and so on can be chosen by you. However, to integrate with Kaggle, you will need to submit Kaggle predictions using our tokenization code.  As a result, **it is probably easiest if you use our tokenization code for the entire project**.\n","5. You will be asked to fill in your code at various points of the document. You will also be asked to answer questions that analyze your results and motivate your implementation. These questions are named Q1-Q8. You may create additional cells to insert code, text and images as necessary.\n","6. Kaggle is not able to calculate *span-level* P/R/F1 measures, which is the standard way to evaluate this type of sequence-tagging task. And we don't actually care so much about the token-level tagging accuracy, which Kaggle **can** calculate.  In particular, there are many fewer propaganda tokens than non-propaganda ones, so always guessing \"non-propaganda\" would produce a very high accuracy.  So we are compromising by using token-level **weighted accuracy**.  Here is how it works:\n","\n","A **weighted accuracy** metric that favors finding propagandistic tokens over non-propagandistic ones. The weights for both classes are the inverse of their frequencies.  \n","\n","``` \n","frac_propaganda = num_propaganda/num_labels   [in the answer key]\n","weight_propaganda = 1/frac_propaganda  \n","weight_non_propaganda = 1/(1-frac_propaganda)\n","\n","weighted_accuracy = \n","   ((weight_propaganda * # propaganda correct) \n","                      +\n","   (weight_non_propaganda * # non_propaganda correct)) / \n","   \n","   ((weight_propaganda * num_propaganda) \n","                      +\n","   (weight_non_propaganda * num_non_propaganda))\n","```  \n","This is also known as the **macro average**, i.e., the average of the accuracy for each label type.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"sGG5rb9Hp6Yx"},"source":["# Task and dataset\n","\n","---\n","\n","1.

Use the classifier to learn a probability $P(t_i|features)$. You may replace either the lexical generation probability â€“ $P(w_i|t_i)$ â€“ or the transition probability â€“ $P(t_i|t_{iâˆ’1})$ â€“ in the HMM with it, or you may replace the entire *lexical generation probability * transition probability*  calculation â€“ $P (w_i|t_i) âˆ— P (t_i|t_{iâˆ’1)} â€“ $ in the HMM with it. \n","\n","3. To train such classifier, you need to pick some feature set. The content of the feature set is up to your choice. You should be trying different feature sets, and evaluate your choices on the validation set. Pick the feature set that performs overall the best according to the F1 measure.\n","\n","4. Use your own implementation of the **Viterbi algorithm**, which you can modify from the one you developed for the HMM model. You will need the probabilities that you obtain from the MaxEnt classifier. \n","\n","5.
